Hungry Bear - a game, the goal is to eat as many Apples, Bananas and Bread as possible in 30 seconds, press spacebar to start the game and using the arrow keys to move up/down/left/right, the bounds of the game set by the red "limit" line. 

Apples are worth: 5 food points
Bananas are worth: 15 food points
Bread is worth: 20 food points

The "catch" is that if you miss a food item, the game will subtract double the points for each food item:

Apple will subtract -10 food points
Bananas will subtract -30 food points
Brad will subtract: -40 food points
