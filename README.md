## Hungry Bear - Game

The goal is to eat as many Apples, Bananas and Bread as possible in 30 seconds, press spacebar to start the game and using the arrow keys to move up/down/left/right, the bounds of the game set by the red "limit" line. 

- Apples are worth: 5 food points<br>
- Bananas are worth: 15 food points<br>
- Bread is worth: 20 food points<br>

The "catch" is that if you miss a food item, the game will subtract double the points for each food item:

- Apple will subtract -10 food points<br>
- Bananas will subtract -30 food points<br>
- Brad will subtract: -40 food points<br>
